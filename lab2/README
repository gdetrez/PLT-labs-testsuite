Building the testsuite
======================

To build the testsuite, the easiest is to use the provied makefile:

  $ make

If you don't have gnu make installed, you can use this command 

  $ ghc -threaded --make -o progs-test-lab2 progs-test-lab2.hs


Running the testsuite
=====================

To run the testsuite, you first have to be in its directory:

  $ cd lab2-testsuite

Run progs-test-lab2 with the path to the directory where your solution is located:
  $ ./progs-test-lab2 path/to/your/solution/
